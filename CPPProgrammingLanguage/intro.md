# The C++ build process

Source code -> Compiler -> Object code -> Linker (linking C++ Standard Library and other libraries) -> Executable program

- Source code: .cpp, .h
- Object code: .o, .obj
- Standard Library: iostream, string, vector, etc.
- Executable program: .exe, .out

## What is object code?

In C++, the object code refers to the output generated by the compiler after it has processed the source code files. Here’s a breakdown of what happens:

1. **Compilation**: The C++ compiler takes each source code file (usually with extensions like `.cpp` or `.cc`) and compiles it into an object file. This object file contains machine code, which is a binary representation that the computer's processor can execute, but it isn’t yet a complete executable program.

2. **Object Files**: These files typically have a `.o` or `.obj` extension and include binary code (machine code) for the functions defined in the corresponding source files. This code has not yet been linked, which means it might still have references to functions and variables in other object files or libraries that it depends on.

3. **Linking**: After all the source files are compiled into object files, a linker is used to combine these object files into a single executable or library. During this process, the linker resolves references to functions and variables across object files, and handles external dependencies such as system libraries.

Object code is essentially a transitional state between human-readable source code and a fully linked executable that the computer can run. It allows for modular compilation, where each source file can be compiled independently and linked later, which can speed up development and make managing large projects more efficient.
