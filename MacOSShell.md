The error `AppleXPC: Failed to connect to service com.vmware.IDHelper` indicates that VMware Fusion is unable to connect to a required system service, which could be causing the initialization process to fail. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. **Check if the Service is Running**:

- The `com.vmware.IDHelper` service is essential for VMware Fusion to function correctly. If this service isnâ€™t running, VMware Fusion will not be able to initialize properly.
- **Steps**:

  1.  Open the Terminal app.
  2.  Run the command: `sudo launchctl list | grep vmware`
  3.  This will list all VMware-related services. Check if `com.vmware.IDHelper` is listed and running.

- **Solution**: If the service is not running, try manually loading it with the command:
  ```
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vmware.IDHelper.plist
  ```

### 2. **Repair Disk Permissions**:

- Sometimes, issues with file permissions can prevent services from running correctly.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Open the Terminal.
  2.  Run the following command to repair disk permissions:
  ```
  sudo diskutil resetUserPermissions / `id -u`
  ```
  3.  Restart your Mac after the process completes.

### 3. **Reinstall VMware Fusion**:

- If the `com.vmware.IDHelper` service is missing or corrupted, reinstalling VMware Fusion might restore it.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Uninstall VMware Fusion by dragging it to the Trash.
  2.  Delete any remaining VMware-related files in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`, `/Library/Preferences/`, and `~/Library/Preferences/`.
  3.  Download and reinstall the latest version of VMware Fusion.

### 4. **Check System Integrity Protection (SIP)**:

- System Integrity Protection (SIP) can sometimes block certain operations. Ensure that SIP is configured correctly.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Reboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by holding `Cmd + R` during startup.
  2.  Open Terminal from the Utilities menu.
  3.  Check the status of SIP by running:
  ```
  csrutil status
  ```
  4.  If SIP is fully enabled, try disabling it temporarily (not recommended unless necessary):
  ```
  csrutil disable
  ```
  5.  Reboot your Mac, and then try reinstalling VMware Fusion.

### 5. **Manually Load the Daemon**:

- If the `com.vmware.IDHelper` service is not loading automatically, you can try loading it manually.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Open the Terminal app.
  2.  Run the command:
  ```
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.vmware.IDHelper.plist
  ```
  3.  Verify that the service is now running with:
  ```
  sudo launchctl list | grep vmware
  ```

### 6. **Check for Conflicting Software**:

- Some security software or other virtualization software may conflict with VMware Fusion, preventing it from accessing necessary services.
- **Solution**: Temporarily disable any third-party security software and see if VMware Fusion starts correctly. Additionally, ensure no other virtualization software is running simultaneously.

### 7. **Contact VMware Support**:

- If the above steps do not resolve the issue, it might be necessary to contact VMware Support. Provide them with the detailed logs, including the `vmware-vmfusion.log`, to help them diagnose the problem.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with VMware Fusion failing to connect to the `com.vmware.IDHelper` service.

```shell
launchctl list | grep vmware
```

This command will list all the services that are running on the system and then filter out the services that contain the word `vmware`.

- `launchctl list`: List all the services that are running on the system.
