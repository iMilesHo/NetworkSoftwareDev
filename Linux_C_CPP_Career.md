# C++ backend Career

Career types in C++ backend development include:

- （量化） Quantitative Developer
- （高性能） High-Performance Computing Developer
- Security developer
- CDN developer (Content Delivery Network)
- Game Server Developer
- Foundation Library Developer
- Virtual Machine Developer
- Network Protocol Developer
- Database Developer
- (流媒体) Streaming Media Developer
- Financial Software Developer
- (推荐算法) Recommendation Algorithm Developer

## Notes

We could learn C/C++ and other GC languages (golang) to become a C++ backend developer.

# Data Structure and Algorithm (Important)

- hash table
- red-black tree
- linked list
- b/b+ tree

# Design Pattern

Highly related to a specific programming language, such as C++.

- Singleton
- (工厂) Factory
- (策略) Strategy
- (观察者) Observer
- (迭代器) Iterator
- (过滤器) Filter

# Standard Library

- STL
- C++ new features (but not necessary)
- Linux project
  - management tools (make, cmake, etc.)
  - git/svn
  - shell script
  - htop, top, etc.
  - netstat
  - tcpdump
  - iperf

# Network Programming

- network programming
  - select/poll/epoll
  - multi-threading and multi-processing
  - (阻塞/非阻塞) Blocking/Non-blocking
  - (同步/异步) Synchronous/Asynchronous
  - (IO 多路复用) IO Multiplexing
  - bussiness logic
- network principle
  - ethernet
  - ip
  - tcp
  - udp
  - http

## Notes

- Implement a tcp （协议栈） protocol stack
- Implement a http server

## Foundational Components of C++ Backend Development (Wheels)

We should have the ability to implement the following components which contain the fixed patterns and algorithms:

- (池化) Pool
  - memory pool
  - thread pool
  - database connection pool
  - request pool
- atomic operation
- ring buffer
- non-blocking queue
- timer
- deadlock detection
- memory leak detection
- log
- network library
- shared memory
- probuf (protocol buffer)

# Middleware

- MySQL
- Redis (nosql)
- Nginx (web server)
- Kafka
- gRPC
- mq (message queue)

# Framework (Fit for different industries)

Based on the previous knowledge, we could learn the following frameworks:

- skynet (game server)
- openresty (Nginx + Lua) (cdn / waf)
- dpdk (data plane development kit) (network)
- spdk (storage performance development kit) (storage)
- cuda (parallel computing) (high-performance computing) (GPU)
- workflow engine (financial software) (quantitative development) (network protocol)

# DevOps

- docker
- k8s
- jenkins
- ansible

# performance optimization

- kernel
  - disk
  - network
  - memory
- bpf/eBPF
- （火焰图） Flame Graph
- gTest

# Distributed System

- distributed database
- distributed file system
- etcd (distributed key-value storage)
