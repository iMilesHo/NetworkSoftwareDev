The error you're encountering when trying to assign a string literal to an array in C++ stems from how arrays work in the language. Specifically, arrays in C++ are not assignable. When you declare an array, the name of the array becomes a constant pointer to the first element of the array, and you cannot change this pointer to point to another memory location after initialization.

Here's a breakdown of why this error occurs and how you can correctly initialize and modify arrays:

### Understanding the Error

1. **Array Initialization vs. Assignment**

   - When you declare an array like `char my_name[8];`, you are setting aside memory for 8 characters.
   - The expression `my_name = "Lyle";` is attempting to assign a new address to the array `my_name`, which is not allowed. Arrays in C++ cannot be assigned to after they are declared because they are not modifiable lvalues.

2. **String Literals are Constant**
   - String literals, such as `"Lyle"`, have a type of `const char[N]` (where `N` is the number of characters including the null terminator). In this case, `"Lyle"` is actually of type `const char[5]`.
   - Assigning a `const char[5]` to a `char[8]` is essentially trying to make `my_name` point to a different memory location, which is forbidden for arrays.

### Correct Ways to Initialize and Modify Character Arrays

To work with character arrays correctly in this context, you can use one of the following methods:

1. **Direct Initialization at Declaration**

   ```cpp
   char my_name[8] = "Lyle";  // Direct initialization is allowed
   ```

   Here, the array is directly initialized with the characters of the string, including the null terminator. The rest of the array (up to 8 elements) will be automatically filled with null characters.

2. **Using `strcpy` for Assignment After Declaration**
   If you need to assign a new string to an array after it has been declared, you should use a function like `strcpy` (from `<cstring>` library), which copies the string into the array character by character:

   ```cpp
   #include <cstring>  // For strcpy
   char my_name[8];
   strcpy(my_name, "Lyle");
   ```

   This method copies the string, including the null terminator, into `my_name` safely, assuming the destination array is large enough to hold the source string.

3. **Using `std::string` for More Flexibility**
   For more flexibility and safety, consider using `std::string` from the C++ Standard Library:
   ```cpp
   #include <string>
   std::string my_name = "Lyle";
   my_name = "Another name";  // Easy and safe reassignment
   ```
   `std::string` handles memory management automatically and allows easy assignments and modifications, which are safer and more intuitive than dealing with C-style strings.

In summary, the error arises due to the non-assignable nature of arrays in C++. Using direct initialization or functions designed for string manipulation like `strcpy` can overcome this limitation. For modern C++ programming, using `std::string` provides a much safer and more flexible alternative.
