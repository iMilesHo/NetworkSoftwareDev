When using `switch` statements in C++, there are several common mistakes and pitfalls to watch out for:

1. **Forgetting `break` Statements**: One of the most common mistakes is forgetting to include a `break` statement at the end of each `case`. Without a `break`, the program continues executing the next `case` block (this is known as "fall through"), which can lead to unexpected behavior.

   ```cpp
   switch (grade) {
       case 'A':
           cout << "Excellent!";
           // Forgot to break here
       case 'B':
           cout << "Well done!";
           break;
       default:
           cout << "Invalid grade.";
   }
   ```

   If `grade` is 'A', it will print both "Excellent!" and "Well done!" due to the fall through.

2. **Duplicate Case Values**: Another mistake is having duplicate `case` labels. Each `case` value in a switch statement must be unique; otherwise, it will result in a compile-time error.

   ```cpp
   switch (num) {
       case 1:
           cout << "One";
           break;
       case 1: // This will cause a compile error because it's a duplicate
           cout << "Uno";
           break;
   }
   ```

3. **Using Non-constant Expressions**: The expressions used in `case` labels must be constant expressions. Variables and non-constant expressions are not allowed.

   ```cpp
   int a = 10;
   switch (num) {
       case a: // Error: case expression is not a constant
           cout << "Ten";
           break;
   }
   ```

4. **Mismatched Data Types**: The expression in the `switch` and the values in the `case` statements should be of the same type or compatible types. If they are not, it may lead to unexpected behavior or compilation errors.

   ```cpp
   switch (num) {
       case 10.5: // Error if num is an integer
           cout << "Ten Point Five";
           break;
   }
   ```

5. **Default Case at Wrong Place**: While itâ€™s not an error to place the `default` case anywhere within the `switch` statement, placing it somewhere other than the end can lead to readability and maintainability issues. It is generally expected to find the `default` case at the end of the switch statement.

   ```cpp
   switch (num) {
       default: // It's better for readability to place this at the end
           cout << "Unknown";
           break;
       case 10:
           cout << "Ten";
           break;
   }
   ```

6. **Forgetting About Scope**: Variables declared in a `switch` statement without braces are in the same scope as the `switch`, which might lead to scope-related issues, like redeclaration errors or unexpected behavior in case of fall-throughs.

   ```cpp
   switch (num) {
       case 1:
           int x = 10; // Declared in case 1
           break;
       case 2:
           x = 20; // Error if case 1 did not execute
           break;
   }
   ```

To prevent these issues, always ensure your `case` values are unique, your `break` statements are correctly placed, and your data types are matched. It's also a good practice to compile and test your code regularly to catch errors early.
