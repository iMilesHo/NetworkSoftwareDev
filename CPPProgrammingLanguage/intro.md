# C++ Programming Language - Introduction

- Powerful:
  - fast, flexible, scalable, portable
  - procedural, object-oriented

## History

- 1970s: C language, Dennis Ritchie, (Unix operating system)
- 1979: C with Classes, Bjarne Stroustrup
- 1983: name changed to C++
- 1989: first commercial release
- 1998: C++98 standard
- 2003: C++03 standard
- 2011: C++11 standard
- 2014: C++14 standard
- 2017: C++17 standard

- Classical C++
  - pre C++11 standard

## Modern C++

- C++11:
  - Lots of new features
- C++14:
  - Minor improvements
- C++17:
  - Minor improvements
- Best practice
- Core Guidelines

# The C++ build process

Source code -> Compiler -> Object code -> Linker (linking C++ Standard Library and other libraries) -> Executable program

- Source code: .cpp, .h
- Object code: .o, .obj
- Standard Library: iostream, string, vector, etc.
- Executable program: .exe, .out

## What is object code?

In C++, the object code refers to the output generated by the compiler after it has processed the source code files. Here’s a breakdown of what happens:

1. **Compilation**: The C++ compiler takes each source code file (usually with extensions like `.cpp` or `.cc`) and compiles it into an object file. This object file contains machine code, which is a binary representation that the computer's processor can execute, but it isn’t yet a complete executable program.

2. **Object Files**: These files typically have a `.o` or `.obj` extension and include binary code (machine code) for the functions defined in the corresponding source files. This code has not yet been linked, which means it might still have references to functions and variables in other object files or libraries that it depends on.

3. **Linking**: After all the source files are compiled into object files, a linker is used to combine these object files into a single executable or library. During this process, the linker resolves references to functions and variables across object files, and handles external dependencies such as system libraries.

Object code is essentially a transitional state between human-readable source code and a fully linked executable that the computer can run. It allows for modular compilation, where each source file can be compiled independently and linked later, which can speed up development and make managing large projects more efficient.

## Keywords

- C++ has 90 keywords.
  - E.g. `int`, `float`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `do`, `class`, `public`, `private`, `protected`, `friend`, `virtual`, `static`, `const`, `volatile`, `mutable`, `extern`, `register`, `typedef`, `sizeof`, `new`, `delete`, `operator`, `this`, `return`, `break`, `continue`, `goto`, `switch`, `case`, `default`, `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `static_cast`, `reinterpret_cast`, `template`, `typename`, `using`, `namespace`, `inline`, `explicit`, `true`, `false`, `bool`, `char`, `wchar_t`, `short`, `long`, `double`, `void`, `auto`, `union`, `struct`, `enum`, `volatile`, `mutable`, `const`, `static`, `extern`, `register`, `signed`, `unsigned`, `constexpr`, `noexcept`, `nullptr`, `decltype`, `alignas`, `alignof`, `asm`, `delete`, `new`, `operator`, `sizeof`, `typeid`, `and`, `and_eq`, `bitand`, `bitor`, `compl`, `not`, `not_eq`, `or`, `or_eq`, `xor`, `xor_eq`.
- Jave has 50 keywords.
- C has 32 keywords.
- Python has 33 keywords.

## Indentifier

- An identifier is a name given to a variable, function, class, etc.

## C++ Preprocessor

Preprocessor is a program that processes our source code before it passes through the compiler. It begins with a hash symbol (#).

When preprocessor encounters a hash symbol, and find the command after it, the preprocesser will execute the command.

E.g. #include
When the preprocesser encounters this command, it will replace the line with the content of the file that the command is pointing to and it is recursively until all the files are included.

As the preprocesser is a separate program, it is not part of the compiler. It is a separate program that runs before the compiler. It will strip off all the comments and all the preprocessor directives and then pass the code to the compiler.

So the C++ preprocessor does not know anything about the C++ language. It only knows about the preprocessor directives.

## Comments

- Single Line Comment
  - `// This is a single line comment`. (Forwards slash)
- Multi Line Comment
  - `/* This is a multi line comment */`. (Forwards slash and asterisk)
