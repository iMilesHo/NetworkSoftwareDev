# C++ String

std::string is a class in the standard Template Library (STL)

- #include <string>
- std namespace
- coontiguous in memory
- dynamic in size
- work with input/output streams
- lots of useful member functions
- our familiar operators work with strings (e.g., +, +=, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, [], etc.)
- can be easily converted to C-style strings if needed
- safer
